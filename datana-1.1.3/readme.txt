 To install the Data Analysis Toolbox:

  - create a separate directory

  - copy the files from the directory 'datana' on this disk

  - make sure that the new directory, containing the toolbox files,
    is in your Matlab path (e.g., for Windows Matlab, edit 'matlabpath'
    in the file 'matlabrc.m')
